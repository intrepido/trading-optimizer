# Trading Optimizer

This tool was built with Vue 3 (Composition API `<script config>`) + TypeScript + Vite + Bootstrap 5.
The main goal of this project is to provide a useful tool to identify entry opportunities and price direction based on common traders analysis such as Market Sentiment, Patterns, Divergences and Operation Types (Breakouts/Pullbacks).
